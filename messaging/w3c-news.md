FOR REVIEW: *WAI-Adapt Registry for AAC Symbols* First Public Draft Registry specification

The Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) WAI-Adapt Task Force (WAI-Adapt) welcomes feedback on the first public Draft Registry specification of the [WAI-Adapt Registry for AAC Symbols](https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-registry/).

The purpose of this specification is to support Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) symbols in web content. Millions of users comprehend AAC symbols better than standard text, but there are multiple AAC symbol sets and they are not mutually comprehensible. To solve this issue and make it possible for content creators to support AAC users in web content, this specification:

- This specification brings Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept indexing to web content.

- Authors can associate a BCI index value with a span of text corresponding to the defined concept expressed as standard text.

- User agents can display the corresponding AAC symbol from the user's preferred symbol set by allowing the user to configure for their preferred AAC symbol set.

- Currently, BCI concepts are expressed only in English, but additional languages will be supported in the near future.

- The BCI concept index is constantly evolving and newly added concepts will be added to this registry periodically.

- A mechanism allowing updating of existing symbol sets, and the addition of yet more AAC symbol sets will be supported.
