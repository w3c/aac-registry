Subject: For Review: Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) Symbol Registry

Dear WAI Interest Group,

W3C WAI invites you to comment on the First Public Draft Registry of:
       W3C Alternative and Augmented Communication (AAC) Symbol Registry
       https://www.w3.org/TR/aac-registry/

Background:
Symbols are visual representations of words and ideas. Symbol-based communication is used by some people who cannot communicate using speech alone and who have low literacy with text and better fluency with symbols. Symbols are used in many alternative and augmented communication (AAC) systems. For example, the user selects symbols and the AAC device speaks the words.
A W3C registry is a data set.[1]

The W3C AAC Symbol Registry provides an extensible registry for the Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept index. This index provides a mapping between concepts expressed in standard text and corresponding symbols in major augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) symbol sets in use today.

To comment, please use one of the following two methods:
* By GitHub: Please open a new issue in the WAI-Adapt GitHub repository:
       https://github.com/w3c/aac-registry/issues/new
* By email: Please send comments in e-mail to <public-adapt@w3.org>. Include [Registry] at the beginning of the subject line of your email message.

Please create separate GitHub issues or email messages for each topic you address, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue or message.

Please send comments by 13 January 2023.

Regards,
Sharon D Snider and Lionel Wolberger, WAI-Adapt Task Force Facilitators
