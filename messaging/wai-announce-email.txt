The AAC Registry provides an extensible registry for the Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept index. This index provides a mapping between concepts expressed in standard text and  corresponding symbols in major Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) symbol sets in use today.

For in-progress updates to the document, see the Editors' Draft at:

https://w3c.github.io/aac-registry/

please open a new issue in the [WAI-Adapt GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/aac-registry/issues/new).

* By email:
Please send comments in e-mail to <public-adapt@w3.org>. Include [Registry]
as the beginning of your subject line in your email message.

Whether you comment in a github issue or by email, please create separate
