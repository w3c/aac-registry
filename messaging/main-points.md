- This specification brings Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI) concept indexing to web content.

- Authors can associate a BCI index value with a span of text corresponding to the defined concept expressed as standard text.

- User agents can display the corresponding AAC symbol from the user's preferred symbol set by allowing the user to configure for their preferred AAC symbol set.

- Currently, BCI concepts are expressed only in English, but additional languages will be supported in the near future.

- The BCI concept index is constantly evolving and newly added concepts will be added to this registry periodically.

- A mechanism allowing updating of existing symbol sets, and the addition of yet more AAC symbol sets will be supported.
